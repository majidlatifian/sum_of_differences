# Sum of Differences

This code calculates the sum of the differences between adjacent elements in a list of three integers.

## Usage

1. Enter three integers separated by spaces when prompted.
2. The program will sort the integers and calculate the differences between adjacent elements.
3. The sum of these differences will be displayed as the output.

## Example
```
Input: 5 2 8
Output: 9
```
```
Explanation: 
The sorted list is [2, 5, 8]. The differences between adjacent elements are (5-2) + (8-5) = 3 + 6 = 9.
```
